I am a PhD student in the Communications and Signal Processing (CSP) group at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Prof. Pier Luigi Dragotti. I received a M.Sc. (2020) and B.Sc (2017) degree in Instrumentation Science and Technology from the Beihang University (Beijing, China). My research interests include event-based vision, model-based deep learning, spiking neural networks and image processing.

# News

We have posted another paper about events-to-video reconstruction: [Enhanced Event-Based Video Reconstruction with Motion Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11961). Related code is released in [CISTA-Flow](https://github.com/lsying009/CISTA-Flow)!

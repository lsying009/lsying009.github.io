I am a PhD student in the Communications and Signal Processing (CSP) group at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Prof. Pier Luigi Dragotti. I received a M.Sc. (2020) and B.Sc (2017) degree in Instrumentation Science and Technology from the Beihang University (Beijing, China). My research interests include event-based vision, model-based deep learning, SNNs and remote sensing image processing.
